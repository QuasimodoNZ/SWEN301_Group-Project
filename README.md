<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h3>Python v. 2.7.9</h3>

Add python.exe to the system Path variable as it is not added by default.

<h3>Git</h3>
Can get it from https://mac.github.com/ or https://windows.github.com/ or you can google for linux and specific cases.

<h3>SourceTree</h3>
http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
This is an easy GUI to use for Git that also has options for gitflow. It is not nessary to use sourcetree, but it has an easier learning curve than using the terminal for git and gitflow. If you don't know what gitflow is, it is a branching model for git, you should read up on it here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow
