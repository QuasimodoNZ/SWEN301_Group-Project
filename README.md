<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h3>Python v. 2.7.9</h3>
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Add python.exe to the system Path variable as it is not added by default.

<h3>Git</h3>
Can get it from https://mac.github.com/ or https://windows.github.com/ or you can google for linux and specific cases.

<h3>SourceTree</h3>
http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/
This is an easy GUI to use for Git that also has options for gitflow. It is not nessary to use sourcetree, but it has an easier learning curve than using the terminal for git and gitflow. If you don't know what gitflow is, it is a branching model for git, you should read up on it here https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow

<h3>Django v. 1.8</h3>
Easiest to install with pip, type this into the command line. ```pip install Django```

<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
Easiest to install with pip, type this into the command line. ```pip install django-bootstrap3```

<h2>How to run it</h2>
From the root directory in a command line ```python /KPS/manage.py runserver [port no.]```


From a webbrowser go to ```localhost:[port no.]```, if no port number is entered then the default is 8000.If something is already using that port then have a look at the terminal as it will show the port number.
